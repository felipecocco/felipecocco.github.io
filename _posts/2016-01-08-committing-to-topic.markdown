The challenge this week was to try and sort out the ideas behind our topics in order to make sure that we chose something that was at once feasible, interesting, that would showcase our skills, and that we would also be passionate about so that we could fight through the obstacles we'd inevitably face.

It was really helpful working in groups to try and discuss some of these issues, primarily because it was nice realizing you were hardly the only one struggling with the same questions.

For me, my thesis work is certainly going to come down to two potential ideas, and my conflict is in the fact that both would emphasize a very different skill set and would require me to be doing very different kind of work.

The Ideas
====================


While I am certain I would like to develop an end-to-end technological solution, one of my ideas would necessarily require a lot of backend algorithmic work, whereas the "action" in the other would mostly reside in user experience design. I find both to be really exciting and neat areas, so I am having a hard time committing to one or the other.

Peer Instruction
----------------

Peer instruction is an umbrella term for a set of strategies which teachers can use to leverage student discussion in learning. One particular incarnation of peer instruction has students complete an assessment and then matches students based on their answers in order to foster meaningful discussions in order to weed out misconceptions. Naturally, such discussions are much more fruitful when students who answered questions differently are matched together. In the higher education space, Pearson provides literally the only software directly aimed at facilitating this sort of exchange. It is incredibly expensive, cumbersome to use, and has not received updates in quite some time. For the K-12 space, no solution even exists, and teachers who choose to employ this strategy are left to juggle their own spreadsheets and student groups in order to achieve this task.

In essence, I would propose designing a test-taking application specifically aimed at promoting peer instruction. While similar to many existing test-taking solutions (like Socrative), this tool would be different in the sense that it would also analyze student response vectors and, if warranted, would allow teachers to instantly form discussion groups and to gauge whether or not that discussion yielded results.

With this solution, many of the engineering issues of implementation are quite easily sorted out, and the success of the project would really rest on how fluidly I could desing a user interface -- for teacher and student -- for the project.


Homework Buddy
---------------

I witnessed many of the students that I used to work with struggling mightily with their school work. A pattern that constantly emerged, however, was that students often would not seek help when they started to be left behind, and as administrators we would often realize the severity of the problem far too late. To be sure, many students were simply shirking their responsibilities. However, a significant proportion of students clearly suffered from issues related to anxiety and depression. Unfortunately, the bigger a factor anxiety and depression was in the lives of the students, the less likely they were to seek out help, and the more likely it was that small problems would slowly snowball into big issues.

When you survey the landscape of technological solutions designed to help with school work, most --if not all -- take on the form of some sort of organizer. That is incredibly unhelpful to this kind of student. Ideally, this student would have someone overseeing their work, intimately aware of his or her pace of completion of homework, and perhaps would serve even as a first warning system in case the student started to fall behind.

Last year, the 3-minute game app Lifeline became a huge sensation. Beyond that simple text-based game, more and more we see Apps have nothing but text interfaces. The app Magic, which made a huge splash last year, is nothing but a phone number that you can text. These text-based interfaces are becoming more and more prevalent, and text as a medium is a very compelling design decision, especially if we conider the crowded mobile app landascape.

I imagined designing a service which would communicate with a student simply by text, sort of like a homework butler, who would know all the due dates of assignment and any other relevant information. With that, it could prompt the student to do work, perhaps ask the student how his progress on work was going, etc. With this information, the AI could suggest actions that the student should take, or perhaps even keep tabs on student progress. If the AI notices issues, it could alert the student and potentially even other stakeholders. In that way, should a student's own anxiety and inability to seek out help could be mitigated by this automated system.



Deciding
---------

In all likelihood, the Peer Instruction route is likely where I'll go. I think potentially the second idea is much more groundbreaking a much richer space to explore. The reality, however, is that implementing something even barely functional in that space would require a lot of investment in technical infrastrcture, as well as a lot of work in carefully thinking about scheduling and other practical considerations related to schoolwork. It is undoubtedly the more ambitious idea, but thinking in practical terms, it is also the one most likely to fail.
